# Subgraph Explorer

This is a subgraph explorer for the [Graph](https://thegraph.com/). It allows you to explore the subgraphs deployed to the Graph and their entities.
The idea of this project is to show how to build a subgraph explorer using the Graph, deploy it to the Graph and use it to explore the subgraphs deployed to the Graph and finally consume the data using Nextjs.

## Getting Started :books:

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
**_ Note: This project uses yarn _**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhussein11/subgraph-explorer.git
```

First, you need to install the dependencies for the subgraph explorer.

```bash
cd subgraph-explorer
```

```bash
yarn install
```

After that, you need to install the dependencies for the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the project :running:

To run the project, you need to only run the frontend, because I've deployed the subgraph explorer to the Graph.

```bash
cd frontend
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deploying the subgraph explorer to the Graph :rocket:

To deploy the subgraph explorer to the Graph, I highly recommend you to read the [Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start).
Specifically, you need to read the [Create a Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/create-a-subgraph) and the [Deploy a Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/deploying/subgraph-studio/) sections.
Then, you will understand how to create and deploy a subgraph to the Graph.
